1. Architecture & Integration
    The LMS module integrates with both the Bank's CBS and the Scoring Engine
    Implemented both SOAP and REST API integrations
    The app follows the correct separation of concerns with proper service classes
2. CBS Integration
    Implementation of both required SOAP APIs:
    KYC API for customer information via CBSService.get_customer_info()
    Transaction Data API via CBSService.get_transaction_history()
    Proper authentication with the provided credentials
3. Exposed REST APIs
    Implemented all three required endpoints:
    Subscription API (POST /api/v1/subscribe/)
    Loan Request API (POST /api/v1/loan/request/)
    Loan Status API (GET /api/v1/loan/status/<loan_id>/)
    Documentation is provided in the README
4. Business Logic
    The system prevents customers from applying for another loan when one is already in progress
    It correctly handles the two-step scoring process
5. Scoring Integration
    Implements the two-step scoring process:
    Step 1: Initiate query score (returns token)
    Step 2: Query score using the token
    Includes a retry mechanism with configurable caps
    Provides proper endpoint registration with the Scoring Engine
    Exposes transaction data to the Scoring Engine
6. Additional Enhancements
    Development vs. Production environment switching
    Automatic fallback mechanism when services are unreachable
    Comprehensive error handling
    Detailed documentation
    Mock services for local development
7. Environment & Configuration
    Proper environment variable management
    Database configuration
    Service URLs configuration


The application handles network connectivity issues gracefully with the fallback mechanism implemented, which is particularly important for integrating with external services.
The code structure follows good practices with clear separation between service layers, models, and API endpoints, making the system maintainable and extendable.
