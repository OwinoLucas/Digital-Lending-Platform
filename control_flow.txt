The company is building a Digital Lending Platform that allows a bank to offer small loans to its customers via a mobile app (USSD, iOS, Android). The system integrates with:

A Scoring Engine – Determines if a customer is eligible for a loan and how much they can borrow.
The Bank's Core Banking System (CBS) – Provides customer details and transaction history.
What I Need to Build
I need to develop a Loan Management System (LMS) that:

Connects to the Bank’s CBS to fetch customer info and transaction history.
Connects to the Scoring Engine to get a customer’s credit score and loan limit.
Exposes REST APIs for the mobile app to allow customers to:
Subscribe to the lending service.
Request a loan.
Check their loan status.
How It Works
Customer Signs Up for the Loan Service

The mobile app calls the Subscription API, providing the customer’s number.
Customer Requests a Loan

The mobile app calls the Loan Request API with the customer’s number and loan amount.
the system checks if the customer has any active loans. If yes, they can’t apply again.
Check Customer’s Loan Eligibility

The LMS queries the Scoring Engine in two steps:
Send customer number → Receive a token.
Use token to get score & loan limit (This takes time, so I need a retry mechanism with a limit on attempts).
If scoring fails after retries, the loan request is rejected, and the customer must reapply.
Get Customer Data from the Bank

Fetch customer details using the KYC API.
Fetch transaction history using the Transactions Data API.
Expose Data to the Scoring Engine

The Scoring Engine needs transaction data to assess the customer’s risk.
I need to create an API that the Scoring Engine can call to get this data.
I must register the API endpoint with the Scoring Engine.
